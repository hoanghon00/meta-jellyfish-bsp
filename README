I. Adding the jellyfish-bsp layer to your build
=================================================

--- replace with specific instructions for the jellyfish-bsp layer ---

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the jellyfish-bsp layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the jellyfish-bsp layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-jellyfish-bsp \
    "
